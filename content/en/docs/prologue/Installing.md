## Requirements for the Portable Version

FriskyMouse is a WinForms application that requires NET 7 Desktop runtime to be installed.

The portable version is available in two forms:

1. A portable app that requires .NET 7 Desktop runtime to be installed.
2. A self-contained app that already includes the .NET 7 Desktop runtime.

If you do not have NET 7 Desktop runtime installed, you can install it from [Download .NET 7.0 download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) webpage.

{{< details "Why portable version?" >}}
