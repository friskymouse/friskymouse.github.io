## Requirements

FriskyMouse is a WinForms application that requires NET 7 Desktop runtime to be installed.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) — latest source release
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) — latest LTS version or newer

{{< details "Why portable version?" >}}
Doks uses npm (included with Node.js) to centralize dependency management, making it [easy to update]({{< relref "how-to-update" >}}) resources, build tooling, plugins, and build scripts.
