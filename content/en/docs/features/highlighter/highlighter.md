## Customizing the Spotlight

- The spotlight can be customized to your liking: you can change its color, radius, and opacity (as shown below).
- Additionally, you can add a colored stroke (that is, outline) and a shadow.

â„¹ __NOTE__: The spotlight can be either `filled ellipse` or round `empty circle`. You can use the `Filled Spotlight` switch to enable/disable filled spotlight.

### Adding an Outline

- To add an outline, enable the `Show Outline` switch.
- You can change the outline's color and thickness value. The default border style is set to solid. However, you can choose one from the available styles.

### Adding a Shadow

- Enable the `Show Shadow` switch to include a shadow in the spotlight's drawing.
- From the available options, you can choose a color and adjust the depth of the shadow and its color opacity.
  
The shadow is an outer circle that is rendered after the spotlight's outline (if enabled), or just after the spotlight itself.
