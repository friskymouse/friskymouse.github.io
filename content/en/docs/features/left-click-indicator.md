## Choosing a Ripple Profile

FriskyMouse provides a set of predefined ripple profiles for rendering various shapes and drawing.

The visual properties of the selected ripple profile can be further customized. You can:

- Change the color of the ripple or drawing (if applicable).
- Increase/decrease the value of the ripple's radius.
- Enable/disable color fading, which will be applied while rendering the ripple.
- Increase/decrease the percentage of the fading opacity.

### Animation Options

#### Animation Direction

The ripple animation can progress in three different ways:

- Inward: the selected ripple profile is rendered inside out.
- Outward
- Inward then outward.

#### Animation Speed

The speed of the animation is the rate at which the ripple drawing is rendered. It can be increased if you prefer a fast animation, or decreased if you prefer otherwise.

ðŸ’¡ __NOTE__: The speed of the animation __should be adjusted__ according to the selected easing function. For the ripple to be rendered properly, some easing functions require you to increase or decrease the animation speed.
