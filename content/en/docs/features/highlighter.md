## Customizing the Spotlight

The spotlight can be customized to your liking: you can change its color, radius, and opacity (as shown below). Additionally, you can add a colored stroke (that is, outline) and a shadow.

â„¹ __NOTE__: The spotlight can be either `filled ellipse` or round `empty circle`. You can use the `Filled Spotlight` switch to enable/disable filled spotlight.

### Adding an Outline

An outline can be added to the spotlight by enabling the `Show Outline` switch.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="You can change the outline's color and thickness value. The default border style is set to solid. However, you can choose one from the available styles." />}}
