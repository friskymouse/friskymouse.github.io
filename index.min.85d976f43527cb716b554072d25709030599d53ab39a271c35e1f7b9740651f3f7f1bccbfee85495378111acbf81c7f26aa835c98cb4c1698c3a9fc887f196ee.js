Additionally, you can add a colored stroke (that is, outline) and a shadow. â„¹ NOTE: The spotlight can be either filled ellipse or round empty circle. You can use the Filled Spotlight switch to enable/disable filled spotlight.
Adding an Outline # To add an outline, enable the Show Outline switch. ðŸ’¡ You can change the outline's color and thickness value. The default border style is set to solid. However, you can choose one from the available styles. Adding a Shadow # Enable the Show Shadow switch to include a shadow in the spotlight\u0026rsquo;s drawing. From the available options, you can choose a color and adjust the depth of the shadow and its color opacity. The shadow is an outer circle that is rendered after the spotlight\u0026rsquo;s outline (if enabled), or just after the spotlight itself.

The visual properties of the selected ripple profile can be further customized. You can:
Change the color of the ripple or drawing (if applicable). Increase/decrease the value of the ripple\u0026rsquo;s radius. Enable/disable color fading, which will be applied while rendering the ripple. Increase/decrease the percentage of the fading opacity. Animation Options # Animation Direction # The ripple animation can progress in three different ways:
Inward: the selected ripple profile is rendered inside out. Outward Inward then outward. Animation Speed # The speed of the animation is the rate at which the ripple drawing is rendered. It can be increased if you prefer a fast animation, or decreased if you prefer otherwise.
ðŸ’¡ NOTE: The speed of the animation should be adjusted according to the selected easing function. For the ripple to be rendered properly, some easing functions require you to increase or decrease the animation speed.
ðŸ’¡ The settings are automatically saved, loaded, and applied upon launching FriskyMouse.
